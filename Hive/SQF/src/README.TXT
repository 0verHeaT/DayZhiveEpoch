Source code of dayz_server for the latest version is located here
The only modified file is dayz_server/system/server_monitor.sqf
Original version of this file is always placed in the same folder, but with a .bak extension
This is to enable easy diffing to see what was changed
And the only added feature is the ability to reset vehicles with empty position
Prepackaged pbo files of this source code folder can be found in the PBO dir
